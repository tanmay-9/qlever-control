"""Footer that only rebuilds when the keys it shows change.

Textual rebuilds every key whenever bindings are refreshed, including the
refreshes fired when the terminal window gains or loses focus. Those
rebuilds change nothing on screen, and the replaced key widgets are never
freed (verified with Textual 8.2.8: 200 redundant refreshes leave 400 dead
`FooterKey` widgets behind, surviving a forced garbage collection), which
over a long session degrades the app into a flickering, frozen state.
